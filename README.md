# TSP_Approx_Algorithms
Random Insertion, Cheapest Insertion, MST-based Algorithms

Abstract: 

This report has scrutinized the implementation and analysis of three algorithms to approximate
TSP optimal solution. This study considers two different approach to perform mentioned task. The
first one is to use two algorithm from a family of constructive heuristics that uses a greedy approach to
find a solution, with different guarantees on the quality of the approximation. They are Random Inser-
tion (log(n)-approximate) and Cheapest Insertion (2-approximate) algorithms. The second approach
is to use a 2-approximate algorithm based on MST, that guarantees a good approximation for metric
TSP. The data set consists of 13 graphs, ranging in the size of vertices from 14 to 1000. The important
note regarding graphs is the fact that the triangular inequality is true on all distances(weights) in each
graph.
